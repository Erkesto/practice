# Snake Game 

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game in Java,
created as a project for my 2nd year Computer Science Engineering bachelor's program.
The game is built using Java and provides a nostalgic gaming experience.

### Features
* Control the snake's movement using arrow keys.
* Eat the food to increase the length of the snake.
* The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.
* Track and display the player's score.
* Play again option after the game is over.

### How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
    "  git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game-java.git  "
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the snakegamemain.java file to start the game.
4. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
5. Eat the food (designated by a red square) to grow the snake.
6. Avoid colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body.
