beluga case study:
  to capture viewership you can do three things:
    -search traffic using keywords...
-trend jacking and hope to get going with the current trends...
-utilizing a growth catalyst to get mentioned somewhere...

  you need CTR(click-through rate) and avg view duration(audience retention)
    -you can get watch time by making short and being able videos
by doing this you can make videos that people watch from start to finish
-focus on audio a lot, keep viewers engaged, add variety, and use silence for emphasis
-keep viewers as an active viewer that is demand attention, if you look away
for one second you mis vital context
-videos should have multiple moving parts not just a beginning, middle, and end...
 
  title and thumbnail strategy:
    -write 33 characters(short) inclusive titles and add uniqueness(add random numbers)
eg: Win Any Argument in 9.17 Seconds && When Your Screen Tiem runs out...
-thumbnails are paused just before something happens, leaving you with an
unanswered question and add 1st personal view to add a sense of inclusiveness
- make your videos, thumbnails, and titles stand out
