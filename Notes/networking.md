### IP addresses
Every device has its own unique **_'IP address'_**, provided to it by a network service provider(ISP) through your router.

For example: Every sim on the mobile has its own unique mobile number which it uses to talk to other mobile devices.

To check your laptop IP address go to your command prompt and type 
```cmd
ipconfig
```
