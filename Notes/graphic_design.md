# Psychology in graphic design

## 1. Von Restorff Effect / isolation effect

Statement: when multiple objects are shown the one thing that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.

ways to do it-> 
1. Size
1. Shape
1. Color
1. Layout 

Add a call to action button instead of plain old simple buttons, as it helps to direct attention, 
create interest, and steer decisions in a certain direction. eg:

A prime example of the call to action is the pricing page...

Here they are drawing attention towards the popular price(probably the one which has the most profit for the owner) lighted in blue and the larger box makes it more suggestible and appealing...

You have to make the elements in your design look like they belong together and tell a consistent visual story but you also want to Delight the audience by putting in a few surprises and twists and turns. These creative tweaks prevent boredom for the viewer and render your designs that much more memorable.

Downfall and need to be used with caution:
the problem is using the isolation effects you do take the viewer's attention span onto one pinpointed area depending on how blatant and how obvious the contrast is this can potentially harm the overall execution of a design if Vital information is not taken in by the viewer as they will be focused on one area due to the effect.
Humans have a **very short attention span of 8 seconds** on average.

## 2. Shape Psychology
**Circular shape** generates a positive response within the brain's emotional centers, relating it to community, friendship, or love and unity. But they can also convey perfection and are also quite attention-seeking in nature.

**Oval Shape** suggests sturdiness, endurance and stability(reason why lot of car companies use this shape in there logos)

**Square and rectangles** They create a perception of power and strength.
combined with lines and triangles gives it has professionalism, efficiency, and stability. All appealing to the left part of the brain. creating a balance of practicality and combined with colors of red or blue they invoke a perception of dynamic modernism.
