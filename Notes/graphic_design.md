#1 Von Restorff Effect / isolation effect

Statement: when multiple objects are shown the one object that differs from the rest is most liekly
           to be remembered.
ways to do it->
  size
  shape
  color 
  layout 

add a call to action button instead of plain old simple buttons, as it helps to direct attention, 
create interest and steer decisions in a certain direction.
