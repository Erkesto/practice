#1 Von Restorff Effect / isolation effect

Statement: when multiple objects are shown the one object that differs from the rest is most liekly to be remembered.

ways to do it->
  size

add a call to action button instead of plain old simple buttons, as it helps to direct attention, 
create interest and steer decisions in a certain direction.
eg:

prime example for call to action is pricing page... 
here they are drawing attention towards the popular price(probably the one which has most profit for the owner)
