## CSS Animations
Two ways of achieving this in CSS->
   * Transitions: used when properties are changed interactively(hovered or focused on).
   * Animations: provides keyframes to provide more control over animation on a frame-by-frame basis.
you can also mix both of these to add more depth to your animations and increase user interactions.
